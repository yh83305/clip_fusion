## Usage
Install Deic according to the tutorial in the Detic repository.

Install PyRealSense2.

Use video_recorder.py to collect image sequences.

Edit the configs/xxxx.yaml file.

Use demo_withICP.py for 3D semantic reconstruction based on KinectFusion.

After reconstruction is complete, query in view.py.
